# TODO
- [ ] consistent orange color 
- [ ] use correct tailwindclasses for color to handle dark / light mode
- [ ] see if we like that the navbar is a `container` and not a bit wider
- [ ] polish the offer-grid -> maybe seperate components
    - [ ] add loading state for db fetching
    - [ ] create a offer-card component and then the grid should be a list of offer-cards
    - [ ] show create new entry on empty state
- [ ] make navbar active link match all the subroutes as well so /nachhilfe-anbieten and ./nachhilfe-anbieten/neu are both active
- [ ] offer form should recieve an offer: Offer | null
    - [ ] prefill those values -> if null it will default to nothing?
    - [ ] also insert all the grades but also get the grade of the user (we kinda do that already) and disable all grades which are >= the users grade
