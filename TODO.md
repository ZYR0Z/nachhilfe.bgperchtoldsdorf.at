# TODO
- [ ] we need to add a loading state every page that needs to fetch data from the db
    - [ ] we need to fix the loading on subpages (maybe each card has a loading prop & own load handeling?)
- [ ] make navbar active link match all the subroutes as well so /nachhilfe-anbieten and ./nachhilfe-anbieten/neu are both active
- [ ] offer form should recieve an offer: Offer | null
    - [ ] prefill those values -> if null it will default to nothing?
    - [ ] also insert all the grades but also get the grade of the user (we kinda do that already) and disable all grades which are >= the users grade
